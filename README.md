# StructuredWarnings

> **Disclaimer:** This is an experimental reimplementation of structured
> warnings, based on Ruby 2.4's new warning module. This is not yet ready for
> prime time.

This is an implementation of Daniel Berger's [proposal of structured warnings
for Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328021259/http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/02/structured_warnings_now.html).
They provide dynamic suppression and activation, as well as, an inheritance
hierarchy to model their relations. This library preserves the old `warn`
signature, but additionally allows a `raise`-like use.

For more information on the usage and benefits of this library have a look at
the inspiring article at O'Reilly.

(link to web archive - O'Reilly took it down)



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'structured_warnings'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install structured_warnings


## Compatibility

`structured_warnings` aims to work with all Ruby interpreters. Please file a bug
for any incompatibilities.


Versions of `structured_warnings` before `v0.3.0` are incompatible with Ruby
2.4+. Please upgrade accordingly, if you need Ruby 2.4 compatibility. Please
note on the otherhand, that many class names changed in an incompatible way
with `structured_warnings` `v0.3.0`. This was done to avoid future name clashes.

Here's a table which should ease upgrading.

| v0.2.0 and before            | v0.3.0 and after                                 |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `Warning`                    | `StructuredWarnings::Base`                       |
| `StandardWarning`            | `StructuredWarnings::StandardWarning`            |
| `DeprecationWarning`         | `StructuredWarnings::DeprecationWarning`         |
| `DeprecatedMethodWarning`    | `StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning`    |
| `DeprecatedSignatureWarning` | `StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedSignatureWarning` |


### Test framework support

`structured_warnings` supports both
[test-unit](https://github.com/test-unit/test-unit/) and
[minitest/test](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/) by adding the
`assert_warn` and `assert_no_warn` assertions.

Pull requests which add support for `RSpec` or `minitest/spec` are very welcome.


### Known Issues

In Ruby versions before 2.4, the library may not extend Ruby's built-in
warnings handled by the C-level function `rb_warn`. Therefore warnings like
"method redefined", "void context", and "parenthesis" may not be manipulated by
`structured_warnings`.


## Usage

To get you started - here is a short example

In order to use `structured_warnings` in library code, use the following code.

```ruby
# in lib/...
require 'structured_warnings'

class Foo
  def old_method
    warn StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning, 'This method is deprecated. Use new_method instead'
    # Do stuff
  end
end

# in test/...
require 'test/unit'
require 'structured_warnings'

class FooTests < Test::Unit::TestCase
  def setup
    @foo = Foo.new
  end

  def test_old_method_emits_deprecation_warning
    assert_warn(StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning){ @foo.old_method }
  end
end
```

`StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning` is only one of multiple predefined
warning types. You may add your own types by subclassing
`StructuredWarnings::Base` if you like.

Client code of your library will look as follows:

```ruby
require "foo"

foo = Foo.new
foo.old_method # => will print
               # ... `old_method' : This method is deprecated. Use new_method instead (StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning)
```

But the main difference to the standard warning concept shipped with ruby, is
that the client is able to selectively disable certain warnings s/he is aware of
and not willing to fix.

```ruby
StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning.disable # Globally disable warnings about deprecated methods!

foo.old_method # => will print nothing

StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning.enable # Reenable warnings again.
```

And there is an even more powerful option for your clients, the can selectively
disable warnings in a dynamic block scope.

```ruby
# Don't bug me about deprecated method warnings within this block, I know
# what I'm doing.
#
StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning.disable do
  foo.old_method
end
```

These settings are scoped to the local thread (and all threads spawned in the
block scope) and automatically reset after the block.


## Detailed Documentation

Have closer look at the RDoc of `StructuredWarnings::Warning`,
`StructuredWarnings::Base` and `StructuredWarnings::Base::ClassMethods`.

Part of this library is a set of different warnings:

* `StructuredWarnings::Base`
  * `StructuredWarnings::BuiltInWarning`
  * `StructuredWarnings::StandardWarning`
  * `StructuredWarnings::DeprecationWarning`
    * `StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedMethodWarning`
    * `StructuredWarnings::DeprecatedSignatureWarning`

You are encouraged to use your own subclasses of `StructuredWarnings::Base` to
give as much feedback to your users as possible.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
